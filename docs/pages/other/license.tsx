        <p></p>
        <p>This section defines the licenses for each subcomponent of Logary.</p>
        <h3>Logary Library (Logary-lib)</h3>
          <p>Present at src/Logary[,Tests,PerfTests] and src/adapters/*. Each being a .Net library that you link your own code/software to.</p>
          <p>Non-profits and non-profit projects are free to use without payment, subject to the Terms of Service defined below.</p>
          <p>For-profit or commercial entities must purchase licenses to use Logary for their production environments, subject to the Terms of Service defined below.</p>
        <h3>Logary Dash</h3>
          <p>Present at src/services/Dash and src/targets/Logary.Targets.SSE; a web app and an EventSource/SSE based target.</p>
          <p>Non-profits and non-profit projects are free to use without payment, subject to the Terms of Service defined below.</p>
          <p>For-profit or commercial entities must purchase licenses to use Dash for their production environments, subject to the Terms of Service defined below.</p>
        <h3>Targets</h3>
          <p>Present at src/targets/*, being .Net libraries that you link your own software to, or add as plugins to Rutta.</p>
          <p>Targets incorporated into the Logary code-base cannot be used without using the Logary library, but their code is free to modify, extend and sell under the Apache 2.0 license, unless specified otherwise on a per target basis (see below).</p>
          <p>The following targets' licenses must always be purchased, independent of the for-profit status of the purchasing entity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mixpanel (under <span className="_code"> src/targets/Logary.Targets.Mixpanel </span>) — commercial user analytics, segmentation</li>
            <li>Opsgenie (under <span className="_code"> src/targets/Logary.Targets.Opsgenie) </span> — commercial alerting and monitoring</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All other targets (and their code-bases) are licensed as Apache 2.0 (Appendix A contains links to Apache 2.0).</p>
        <h3>Rutta</h3>
          <p>Present at src/services/*, being an executable program and docker container.</p>
          <p>Rutta is dual-licensed as GPL v3, or as a commercial license. Purchasing a commercial license for Rutta lets you use and extend its source code for your own commercial purposes and not open source that change.</p>
          <p>Present at src/services/*, being an executable program and docker container.</p>
          <p>GPL v3 means that when you want to extend Rutta for your own purposes, you must send a pull request with that change in order to make your improvement available for others to use. This is so that free software can continue to be free. If you don't want to send a pull request with your change, you must purchase the commercial license.</p>
        <h3>Library Façade</h3>
          <p>Present at <span className="_code"> src/Logary[,CSharp].Facade[,.Tests] </span>. Also called the Façade, in short.</p>
          <p>The Façade is Apache 2.0 licensed.</p>
          <p>The Library Façade is distinct from the Façade Adapter, since the Façade is Apache 2.0-licensed code, whilst the Façade Adapter (in <span className="_code"> src/adapters/Logary.Adapters.Facade </span>) doesn't work without Logary-lib.</p>
        <h3><span className="_code"> logary </span> JavaScript library</h3>
          <p>MIT-licensed, see <a href="https://github.com/logary/logary-js/blob/master/LICENSE">logary/logary-js/LICENSE.</a> </p>
          <p>This NPM package is published at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/logary">logary/logary-js/LICENSE.</a> </p>

      <DocSection title='Commercial license' id='commercial-license'>
        <p></p>
        <p>This section defines the terms of the Commercial License.</p>
        <p>The Commercial License is subject to the Terms of Service (ToS) above. It applies to a Work or Software, its source code and the running/deployment of the software.</p>

        <h3>1. Pricing</h3>
        <p>The commercial license must be purchased in order to apply to the Software.</p>
          <h4>1.1 Initial purchase</h4>
          <p>The price in EUR (€) is calculated as follows:</p>
          <span className="_code">price = C * 100 + D * 20 + 250</span>
          <p>where</p>
          <ul>
            <li>C: # of cores in total production deployment</li>
            <li>D: # of developers owning/working on the software</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can load- and stress-test in a test-/staging-environment, for free, as long as that environment never serves production traffic.</p>
          <p>If you change the number of cores you deploy on, or number of developers, please order a delta to your license.</p>

          <h4>1.2 Subsequent years</h4>
          <p>You must renew the license(s) yearly, at a 60% discount of the initial price that a new customer would pay at the instant when the license expires.</p>
          <p>So for example, if you have 5 different services, each with access to 10 cores, and your team is 5 backend and 2 frontend developers, you pay 10 * 100 + 5 * 20 + 250 = €1,350 euro the first year, and €540 every subsequent year if the number of cores used in production and the number of developers "owning"/building the software is the same.</p>

          <h4>1.3 Means of Payment</h4>
          <p>You may choose to pay via invoice (SWIFT/IBAN bank transfer, or via a lightning network invoice), or through credit/debit card.</p>

          <h4>1.4 Terms of Payment</h4>
          <p></p>
          <h5>1.4.1 Invoice</h5>
          <p>The invoice must be paid within 10 days of its issuance.</p>
          <h5>1.4.2 Credit/Debit Card</h5>
          <p>Credit/Debit card payments are immediate.</p>

        <h3>2. Allowances</h3>
          <p>By purchasing this license you may make changes to the Software without open sourcing or sending a pull request with those changes. Furthermore, you are free to link the Software to your own software, under the terms of this license.</p>
        <h3>3. Refunds</h3>
          <p>Unless expressly agreed in writing, before the purchase, there are no refunds, to the extent of the applicable law. If you are purchasing an individual, you have 14 days right to withdrawal according to <a href="https://www.konsumenteuropa.se/en/topics/e-commerce/E-commerce-within-the-EU/right-of-withdrawal-within-the-eu/">Swedish law.</a> </p>
        <h3>4. Order a license</h3>
          <p>Send an e-mail to <span className="_code"> henrik@haf.se </span> with the number of cores and developers you'd like to purchase a license for.</p>
