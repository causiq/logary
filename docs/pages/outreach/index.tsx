        <h1>The big picture is blurry</h1>

        <p>
          Have you experienced the pain of <b>having many different tools</b>, those for marketing,
          further tools for website analytics and the then more tools that assist your ops/dev
          teams observe the system as it's running?
        </p>

        <p>
          We think there's a niche in between the three separate layers of your business; a tool that
          collects and highlights all of the below:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>ad/marketing and attribution data</li>
          <li>company-wide Objective Key Results (OKR:s)</li>
          <li>"dev/ops data" â€” the trinity of tracing, metrics, logs</li>
        </ol>

        <p>so that all three roles can <b>communicate around the same data.</b></p>

        <h2>Does this sound interesting to you?</h2>
