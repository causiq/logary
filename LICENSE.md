Logary is the collective name for:

 - a *logging library* for .Net (Logary-lib) including *adapters*,
 - a *Dash web app* that shows streaming logs in your browser,
 - a number of *target* implementations for the library (things Logary-lib can send logs to),
 - a service called *Rutta* that ships, transforms, enhances or proxies logs,
 - a *Helm chart for Rutta*,
 - a *library façade* for use in your own code, to quickly and easily add structured logging capabilities with no
   dependency on a third party library, and
 - a *JavaScript library* to send logs from web browsers and react-native apps.

If you want to support the eco-system of open source and you're a professional developer using Logary commercially, you
should purchase the commercial license to support Logary's maintenance. For some of Logary, you have purchase
a commercial license, for others, you're don't have to. All of this is detailed below.

All of Logary is under the *Terms of Service* (ToS). These ToS are distinct from the *Commercial License* which is in
turn distinct from any other license applied.

# Logary licencing

This section defines the licenses for each subcomponent of Logary.

## Logary Library (Logary-lib)

Present at `src/Logary{,Tests,PerfTests}` and `src/adapters/*`. Each being a .Net library that you link your own
code/software to.

Non-profits and non-profit projects are free to use without payment, subject to the Terms of Service defined below.

For-profit or commercial entities must purchase licenses to use Logary for their production environments, subject to the
Terms of Service defined below.

## Logary Dash

Present at `src/services/Dash` and `src/targets/Logary.Targets.SSE`; a web app and an EventSource/SSE based target.

Non-profits and non-profit projects are free to use without payment, subject to the Terms of Service defined below.

For-profit or commercial entities must purchase licenses to use Dash for their production environments, subject to the
Terms of Service defined below.

## Targets

Present at `src/targets/*`, being .Net libraries that you link your own software to, or add as plugins to Rutta.

Targets incorporated into the Logary code-base cannot be used without using the Logary library, but their code is free
to modify, extend and sell under the *Apache 2.0* license, unless specified otherwise on a per target basis (see below).

The following targets' licenses must always be purchased, independent of the for-profit status of the purchasing entity:

- Mixpanel (under `src/targets/Logary.Targets.Mixpanel`) — commercial user analytics, segmentation
- Opsgenie (under `src/targets/Logary.Targets.Opsgenie`) — commercial alerting and monitoring

All other targets (and their code-bases) are licensed as Apache 2.0 (Appendix A contains links to Apache 2.0).

## Rutta

Present at `src/services/*`, being an executable program and docker container.

Rutta is *dual-licensed* as **GPL v3**, or as **a commercial license**. Purchasing a commercial license for Rutta lets
you use and extend its source code for your own commercial purposes and not open source that change.

Rutta effectively is an explicit exception to the no-commercial-use of the Logary library, since GPL v3 software admits
running it as a server for commercial purposes. No other exception to the Logary-lib license is implied by this fact.

GPL v3 means that when you want to extend Rutta for your own purposes, you **must send a pull request with that change**
in order to make your improvement available for others to use. This is so that free software can continue to be free. If
you don't want to send a pull request with your change, you must purchase the commercial license.

## Library Façade

Present at `src/Logary{,CSharp}.Facade{,.Tests}`. Also called the Façade, in short.

The Façade is **Apache 2.0** licensed.

The *Library Façade* is distinct from the *Façade Adapter*, since the Façade is Apache 2.0-licensed code, whilst the
*Façade Adapter* (in `src/adapters/Logary.Adapters.Facade`) doesn't work without Logary-lib.

## `logary` JavaScript library

**MIT-licensed**, see [logary/logary-js/LICENSE](https://github.com/logary/logary-js/blob/master/LICENSE).

This NPM package is published at [npmjs.com/package/logary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logary).

3.2. We advice you to ascertain the fitness and functionality of the software yourself by fully testing it for your

## 4. Limitation of Liability

4.1. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Logary's authors are not liable for any direct nor indirect loss
suffered by you, unless they has been found guilty of gross negligence. This limitation of liability includes, but is

You agree that Logary may collect statistics on its usage and runtime environment (operating system name and version,
IP-address, the hostname that is running Logary components, linked library identifiers, etc), by means of communication
with Logary authors' servers.

## 7. Changes to the terms

Logary's authors may make changes to these Terms from time to time. When we introduce changes we will commit the most
current version to this document, and if a revision of the Terms is material and you have made a purchase of the

# Commercial License

This section defines the terms of the Commercial License.

The Commercial License is subject to the Terms of Service (ToS) above. It applies to a Work or Software, its source code
and the running/deployment of the software.

## 1. Pricing

The commercial license must be purchased in order to apply to the Software.

### 1.1 Initial purchase

The price in EUR (€) is calculated as follows:

    price = C * 100 + D * 20 + 250

where

- `C`: # of cores in total production deployment
- `P`: # of developers owning/working on the software

You can load- and stress-test in a test-/staging-environment, for free, as long as that environment never serves production
traffic.

If you change the number of cores you deploy on, or number of developers, please order a delta to your license.

### 1.2 Subsequent years

You must renew the license(s) yearly, at a 60% discount of the initial price that a new customer would pay at the
instant when the license expires.

So for example, if you have 5 different services, each with access to 10 cores, and your team is 5 backend and 2
frontend developers, you pay 10 \* 100 + 5 \* 20 + 250 = €1,350 euro the first year, and €540 every subsequent year if
the number of cores used in production and the number of developers "owning"/building the software is the same.

### 1.3 Means of Payment

You may choose to pay via invoice (SWIFT/IBAN bank transfer, or via a lightning network invoice), or
through credit/debit card.

### 1.4 Terms of Payment

#### 1.4.1 Invoice

The invoice must be paid within 10 days of its issuance.

#### 1.4.2 Credit/Debit Card

Credit/Debit card payments are immediate.

## 2. Allowances

By purchasing this license you may make changes to the Software without open sourcing or sending a pull request with
those changes. Furthermore, you are free to link the Software to your own software, under the terms of this license.

## 3. Refunds

Unless expressly agreed in writing, before the purchase, there are no refunds, to the extent of the applicable law. If
you are purchasing an individual, you have 14 days right to withdrawal according to [Swedish
law](https://www.konsumenteuropa.se/en/topics/e-commerce/E-commerce-within-the-EU/right-of-withdrawal-within-the-eu/).

## 4. Order a license

Send an e-mail to `henrik@haf.se` with the number of *cores* and *developers* you'd like to purchase a license for.
